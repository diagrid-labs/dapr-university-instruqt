# Challenges and Tips

In this final challenge, you'll explore common challenges that workflow as code systems have and how to deal with them.

## 1. Challenges and Tips

Workflows are great tools to ensure durable execution of your code but they also have their limitations. This challenge covers:

- Deterministic workflows
- Idempotent activities
- Workflow versioning
- Payload size

### 1.1 Choose a language tab

Use one of the language tabs to navigate to the code. Each language tab contains several code files to illustrate the challenges and tips.

### 1.2 Deterministic workflows

Use the language specific instructions to inspect the workflow code.

<details>
   <summary><b>.NET</b></summary>

Navigate to the `DeterministicWorkflow.cs` file.

</details>

### 1.3. Idempotent activities

Use the language specific instructions to inspect the activity code.

<details>
   <summary><b>.NET</b></summary>

Navigate to the `IdempotentActivity.cs` file.

</details>

### 1.4. Payload size

Use the language specific instructions to inspect the workflow code.

<details>
   <summary><b>.NET</b></summary>

Navigate to the `PayloadSizeWorkflow.cs` file.

</details>

### 1.5. Workflow versioning

Use the language specific instructions to inspect the workflow code.

<details>
   <summary><b>.NET</b></summary>

Navigate to the `VersioningWorkflow.cs` file.

</details>

Congratulations! You've completed the Dapr University workflow learning track!

All code samples shown in this Dapr University track are available in the [Dapr QuickStarts](https://github.com/dapr/quickstarts/) repository in the `tutorials/workflow` folder. Give this repo a star and clone it locally to use it as reference material for building your next workflow project.

If you want to quickly build workflows based on a workflow diagram, take a look at [Diagrid Workflow Composer](https://diagrid.ws/workflows). You can upload an image, select the language, and this tool will generate a scaffolded Dapr workflow project that you can download and use as a starting point.
