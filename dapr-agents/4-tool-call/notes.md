## Challenge 4: Building an Agent with Custom Tools

In this challenge, you'll learn:

- How to pick different agent types (`ToolCallAgent`, `ReActAgent`, `OpenAPIReActAgent`) that serve distinct purposes
- How to create custom tools with the `@tool` decorator and Pydantic schemas for input validation
- How to configure agents with instructions, tools, and persistent memory using Dapr state stores
- How to run agents with Dapr sidecars and observe the tool-calling process in action

If you need more information about Dapr Agents during (or after) the challenge, visit the [Dapr Agents Docs](https://diagrid.ws/dapr-agents-docs/). If you have any questions or feedback about this track, you can let us know in the *#dapr-agents* channel of the [Dapr Discord server](https://bit.ly/dapr-discord).
