## Description

In this self-paced track, you'll learn:

- What Dapr Agents is and how it simplifies AI application development.
- How to use different LLM clients through the provider-agnostic Dapr Conversation API.
- How to build agents with custom tools and capabilities for intelligent interactions.
- How to integrate with databases through Model Context Protocol (MCP).
- How to implement the ReAct (Reasoning and Action) pattern for complex problem-solving.
- How to achieve durability and resilience in AI applications.
- How to create agentic workflows for orchestrating multi-step AI processes.
- How to build multi-agent systems that collaborate to solve complex tasks.

This track consists of 9 challenges, you'll probably need around 60 minutes to complete all of them.

If your session is idle for more than 7 minutes the session will stop and you'll need to restart the learning track. Tracks can be started up to 5 times and you can skip challenges to continue with the challenges you didn't finish previously.
