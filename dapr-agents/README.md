Dapr Agents - Build LLM-powered intelligent applications with tools and workflows

## Url

dapr-agents

## Teaser

You will learn how to create LLM-powered agentic applications that autonomously take actions to achieve a goal. To get there, you will learn how to call various LLMs, build reliable agents that can invoke tools and MCP servers, create agentic workflows to orchestrate complex processes, and design multi-agent systems that collaborate to solve complex problems.

## Description

In this self-paced track, you'll learn:

- What Dapr Agents is and how it simplifies AI application development.
- How to use different LLM clients and the provider-agnostic Dapr Conversation API.
- How to build agents with custom tool calls for external interactions.
- How to integrate with 3rd party systems through Model Context Protocol (MCP).
- How to implement the ReAct (Reasoning and Action) pattern for complex problem-solving.
- How to achieve durability and resilience in AI applications.
- How to create agentic workflows for orchestrating multi-step AI processes.
- How to build multi-agent systems that collaborate to solve complex tasks.

You'll need an OpenAI API key to complete the challenges in this track. You can get an OpenAI API key by signing up at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup).

This track consists of 9 challenges, you'll probably need around 60 minutes to complete all of them.

If your session is idle for more than 10 minutes the session will stop and you'll need to restart the learning track. Tracks can be started up to 5 times and you can skip challenges to continue with the challenges you didn't finish previously.
