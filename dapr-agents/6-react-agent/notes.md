Click the *Start* button to setup the sandbox environment for this training, this may take up to 1 min 30 sec. Once the environment is ready, click the *Start* button again.

There are 9 challenges to complete. If your session is idle for more than 10 minutes, the session will stop and you'll need to restart the learning track. Tracks can be started up to 5 times and you can skip challenges via the *Progress* button to continue with the challenges you didn't finish previously.

In this challenge, you'll learn:

- What the ReAct (Reasoning + Action) pattern is and how it makes agent thinking explicit and transparent
- How ReAct agents differ from standard tool calling agents in problem-solving approach and complexity
- How to implement ReAct agents with the Thought → Action → Observation cycle in Dapr Agents
- When to use ReAct agents for complex multi-step reasoning tasks versus simpler tool calling agents
