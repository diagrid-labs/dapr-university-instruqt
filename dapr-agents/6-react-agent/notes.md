## Challenge 6: Build Agents using the ReAct Pattern

In this challenge, you'll learn:

- What the ReAct (Reasoning + Action) pattern is and how it makes agent thinking explicit and transparent
- How ReAct agents differ from standard tool calling agents in problem-solving approach and complexity
- How to implement ReAct agents with the Thought → Action → Observation cycle in Dapr Agents
- When to use ReAct agents for complex multi-step reasoning tasks versus simpler tool-calling agents

If you need more information about Dapr Agents during (or after) the challenge, visit the [Dapr Agents Docs](https://diagrid.ws/dapr-agents-docs/). If you have any questions or feedback about this track, you can let us know in the *#dapr-agents* channel of the [Dapr Discord server](https://bit.ly/dapr-discord).
