## Challenge 6: Build Stateful and Resilient Agents

In this challenge, you'll learn:

- How to configure persistent memory, state stores, agent registry, and message bus components
- How durable agents expose REST APIs for interaction and management of long-running workflows
- When to use durable agents versus simpler agent types based on reliability requirements
