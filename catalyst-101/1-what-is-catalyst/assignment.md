- **Bring governance to your projects**: Use projects to enforce proper team ownership, track and audit operations and give access control across all your applications.
- **Optimized workflow engine performance**: Execute long-running, stateful processes reliably without managing infrastructure concerns or scaling. Scale from zero to your highest throughput demands. 
- **Orchestrate long-lived agents with memory**: Out-of-the-box durability for AI-powered applications running anywhere with immediate insight into your agent’s actions, memory, tool calls with visibility into each stage of the agent’s workflow.
