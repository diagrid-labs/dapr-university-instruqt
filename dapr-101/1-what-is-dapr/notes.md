Dapr is a portable, event-driven runtime that makes it easy for any developer to build resilient, stateless, and stateful applications that run on the cloud and edge and embraces the diversity of languages and developer frameworks.

Dapr codifies the best practices for building microservice applications into open, independent APIs called building blocks. The Dapr building block APIs:

- Enable you to build portable applications using the language and framework of your choice.
- Are completely independent
- Have no limit to how many you use in your application

Using Dapr, you can incrementally migrate your existing applications to a microservices architecture, thereby adopting cloud native patterns such scale out/in, resiliency, and independent deployments.

Dapr is platform agnostic, meaning you can run your applications:

- Locally
- On any Kubernetes cluster
- On virtual or physical machines
- In other hosting environments that Dapr integrates with.

This enables you to build microservice applications that can run on the cloud and edge.
