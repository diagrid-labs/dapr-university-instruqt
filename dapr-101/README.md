# Name
Dapr 101 - State Management, Service Invocation, and Pub/Sub APIs

## Teaser
You'll be using the Dapr CLI and get familiar with the State Management, Service Invocation, and Pub/Sub APIs.

## Description

In this self-paced track, you'll learn:
- Why organizations use Dapr to build distributed applications
- How Dapr works
- How to use the Dapr CLI for local development
- How to use the three most popular Dapr APIs: State Management, Service Invocation, and Pub/Sub

You'll probably need around 25 minutes to complete the 5 challenges.
